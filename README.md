# Backend implementation of 'ToDoList' application

Main purpose of this project is to practise implemeting REST application programming interface(API).

Entities:
  1. User
  2. List
  3. Item
  
Busines Logic:
  1. Sign In/Sign Up
  2. Add/Delete list
  3. Add/Delete item
  4. See certain/whole list
  5. See certain/whole item


In the following sections I'm describing implementation of the project in detail, such as packages, config, and other files.

# 'cmd' package
  In this package I have main.go, the starting point of the application, I try to keep it as simple as possible.
# 'server.go'
  Creating and setting of the http server.
